  - Power Query for data cleaning & transformation
  - Power Pivot for data modeling & calculations
  - Pivot Tables & Charts for visualizations

## 🔍 Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning with Power Query**
   - Split the main dataset into two tables:
     - **Loans Table**: Loan-related details
     - **Customer Info Table**: Other customer details
   - This reduced `NULL` and `0` values in unrelated columns.
   - Checked column quality, corrected data types, and ensured accuracy.

2. **Data Modeling with Power Pivot**
   - Created relationships between the two tables.
   - Built general measures:
     - Average Income
     - Average Loan Interest
     - Total Loan Amount

3. **Visualization**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard in Excel.
   - Visual elements include:
     - Average loan interest
     - Total loans overview
     - Income vs. expenses distribution
